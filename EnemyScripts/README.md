# Enemy Scripts

 These are the blender scripts we used for making custom enemy models, it's basically the same scripts you use for character skins here: https://github.com/KingEnderBrine/-RoR2-BlenderScripts/tree/master/CharacterScripts
 
 
 
# Side Note

 From my memory, this only affects Beetle and Beetle Guard, but they are kinda messed up to the point where I have to reset their SkinnedMeshRenderer bones in C# code when importing them, if you have any questions reach out to me at Metrosexual Fruitcake#6969
