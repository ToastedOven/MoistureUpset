# Moisture Upset
 Moisture Upset is a passion project we have been working on for the last 5 months.
 
 Check out one or both of these trailers to get a good feel for what we have created.

It's hard to say exactly what this mod changes since we do so much. As a general statement, all enemies in the vanilla game, have had a "makeover" (complete with sound effects!)

In addition to enemies we also have a custom TF2 skin for the engi (complete with his own sounds as well!)

There are also a few changes here and there, such as the cursor being much more... uhh... visible.

If you want a complete "list" of sorts of what changed, this gif should give you a decent overview of what you are getting yourself into: https://gfycat.com/ignorantpettykagu

As you may have noticed in that gif, we have an options menu! When Rune released risk of options forever ago, it was originaly with Moisture Upset in mind. We know not everyone is on the same wavelength as us in what they find funny, so the good news is, minus the engi skin due to complications, everything in the mod can be toggled off if desired, just check your settings menu in game. Some of these settings change models, please understand that for the sake of performance, model replacements are done at startup, so if you toggle on/off a model you will need to restart your game for it to take full effect. In general though, the sound sliders are done in real time.

As far as we know, there aren't any current issues with either single or multiplayer, but please don't hesitate to message us if you find something wrong.

# Changelog

 1.2.0: Fixed issues with the FrankasaurusEngi mod (and probably other engi mods) Changed the chance shrine and the triple shops. Added a setting which disables everything except the survivor skins, make sure to check this if you only want to use the survivor skins we implement! (Also increases load times dramatically since we don't load stuff you don't want)

 1.1.4: Fixed issue with font's becoming lines... yeah I'm kinda stupid

 1.1.3: Fixed a critical error which caused the chest replacements to depend on debugtoolkit, to put it simply, it seems like some part of debugtoolkit modifies how the SpawnCards are handled, causing a reset which normally happens to not. For anyone who doesn't use debugtoolkit, which is probably most, enjoy your chest facelift, for real this time! We also fixed a material issue with the Engi skin.

 1.1.2: Added the code for the big money amounts, oops.

 1.1.1: Added Chip the Beetle support! Adjusted Shulker Boxes to be orange so that they stand out about as well as the equipment barrels are supposed to. Currency has been changed up a bit to be more accurate to real life costs...

 1.1.0: Added Direseeker support, be sure to check him out if you have it installed! Chests have been given a facelift. A few bug fixes.

 1.0.6: Fixed issue where with float parsing on computers that might expect a comma instead of a period.

 1.0.5: Added support for a few of the "play as" mods. Fixed a bug with music not stopping in the bazaar. Direseeker support coming soon!

 1.0.4: Fixed a conflict with rob's Twitch mod, if you have Moisture Upset and rob's Twitch mod installed I 100% recommend you update!
 
 1.0.3: I am a stupid donkey and broke the bazaar/defeat music with the last patch. It's fixed now, feel free to ignore this update if that doesn't bother you.
 
 1.0.2: Actually uploaded the dll this time, sorry everyone. You should have your sliders now!
 
 1.0.1: Updated ReadMe, added extra volume sliders for more customization
